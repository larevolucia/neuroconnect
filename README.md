# NeuroConnect

Neurodivergent individuals (such as those with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, etc.) often face unique challenges in daily life. For expats, these challenges are exacerbated by unfamiliarity with the healthcare system, lack of government support, language barriers, and isolation from social networks.

Despite growing international awareness and a significant increase in diagnoses, support for expats remains limited, making it difficult to find professional guidance and community resources.

This site aims to create a community hub for autistic expats and their families in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. With an inclusive approach, it seeks to provide support to individuals from diverse social and economic backgrounds, offering a range of services, from professional assistance by certified coaches to volunteer-led community support and social events.

## Design

Design choices took in consideration insights from web design research done with autistic individuals. There's a minimal page structure variation and use of imagery to reduce cognitive load.

### Images

Research with target audience on preference of information in text vs in image is not conclusive. With that in mind, it was chosen to use images withou excess to convey additional information for individuals that process through images, while keeping a suscint text for those who process through written communication. 

While chosing images there was an attempt to chose images with not too many colors or elements with the intent to making them easy to digest.

### Colors

The colors selected for the site were chosen based on research done with autistic users, where it was pointed out that blues and green where calming colors. The palette was generated by Coolors platfomr and tweaked to achieve contrast values required by WCAG guidelines.

</details>


### Fonts

Lexend font was selected for the body font, due to it's readability characteristics. Considering that there is an overlap between autism and dyslexia, having a dyslexic-friendly font was deemed as a must. 
Roboto Slab was selected as a heading font to help differentiating levels of importance of content. 
Both fonts are imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Features

### Navigation

- Fully responsive navigation bar with design optimitization is achieve by the use of media queries. 
- Small screens use a left side logo and a right side menu icon to optimize space. 
- Click behavior on menu icon on smaller screen are achieve by using a checkbox input that is set to hidden. The icon is set as checkbox label. 
- Larger screens display site's name along with logo and display site's section horizontally. Menu icon is hidden using media queries.
- Distinctive color is used to indicate active page. Softer color is used to indicate cursor hover.
- Fixed navigation was achieven using position:sticky together with left and top attributes to set its position on screen.
- It was decided not to nest ```<nav>``` element in the ```<header>```, due to [accessibility recommendations](https://dev.to/masakudamatsu/don-t-nest-nav-inside-header-do-nest-the-hamburger-menu-button-inside-nav-6cp).

### Skip to Main Content

- A link to skip to the main content was included to facilitate navigation using keyboard. 
- Link has fixed position with negative top value, making it hidden for users. Link becomes visible if user press tab on page first load due to change on fixed position using :focus pseudo class.

### Header 

- All pages follow the same ```<header>``` structure for design consistency necessary to reduce cognitive load when navigating in a new site.
- Hero banner uses ```background-image``` property to populate the HTML with it's content using distinctive ids.
- Overlay text is positioned near the bottom right corner of the image using ```position: absolute```. A semi-transparent ```background-color``` is applied to the text container to ensure readability.

### Services 

- More in-depth information about the services is provided in ```<main>``` element of the Services pages.
- Responsive design was achieved using ```display: flex``` applied to ```<main>```. 
- As the page is more text heavy, it was decided to use [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons as visual conterparts to reduce visual stimuli on page.
- Feedback of initial design was still deemed text-heavy, so a new design with a collapsible element was implemented on commit [5d11e3a](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/commit/5d11e3a1214a45294f81af5cc2b01f3dee0ec9ef).

### Bugs & Issues

All issues are documented in this [Project View](https://github.com/users/larevolucia/projects/3/views/4)

- Jigsaw CSS validator error: unkown pseudo-class :user-valid. Although documentation on it can be found online at [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_user-valid.php) and and [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:user-valid), I chose to remove it and simplify the form validation experience. Documented on [issue #20](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/20#issue-2611899383)
- Click on label was not selecting corresponding radio button option on forms. Using the W3 check I found that it was due to duplication of ids on content cards and radio buttons. I renamed the content cards id's to be able to fix it. Documented on [issue #21](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/21#issue-2612109157)
- Code clean-up lead to home button misalignment on large screens. To fix it I added a ```min-heigh``` to the ```.card-text``` class on media query for large screens. Documented on [issue #22](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/22#issue-2614516551)
- Initial mobile score for performance was around 75. To improve the score I converted images to webp format, set ```loading="lazy"``` and added difference sources depending on screen size using ```<picture>``` + ```<source>```. Documented on [issue #24](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/24#issue-2618947783)
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) flagged label used for burger menu as an error. To fix it, I added a span to add the text "Menu". To hide it from users, I added a class with ```display: none```. Docummented on [issue #26](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/26#issue-2626933126)
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) flagged ```alt-text``` from a image on home with an alert. To fix it, I changed the text to remove redundancy of "Image of" and made more concise. Docummented on [issue #26](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/26#issue-2626933126)
- After changing image cards to use ```<picture>``` with specific ```source``` for screen distinct screen sizes, the image on home for the events was broken on mobiles. That was due to a broken url, which was fixed on [61c780d](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/commit/61c780df34f5e0a4931dca4c1acae4fae431ad9f). Documented on [issue #27](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/27)
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) alerted the paragraphs for Date and Location on event content cards as possible headings. Peer review provided feedback on the elements, suggesting using semantic elements. Applying the suggestion eliminated the alert. Documented on [issue #29](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/29#issue-2635708429)
- Error on HTML validator on Services page: ```div``` cannot be child of ```span```. Replaced ```span``` with ```div``` to fix the issue. Documented on [issue #28](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/28)

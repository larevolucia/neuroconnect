# NeuroConnect

Neurodivergent individuals (such as those with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, etc.) often face unique challenges in daily life. For expats, these challenges are exacerbated by unfamiliarity with the healthcare system, lack of government support, language barriers, and isolation from social networks.

Despite growing international awareness and a significant increase in diagnoses, support for expats remains limited, making it difficult to find professional guidance and community resources.

This site aims to create a community hub for autistic expats and their families in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. With an inclusive approach, it seeks to provide support to individuals from diverse social and economic backgrounds, offering a range of services, from professional assistance by certified coaches to volunteer-led community support and social events.

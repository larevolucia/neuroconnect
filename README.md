# NeuroConnect

Neurodivergent individuals (such as those with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, etc.) often face unique challenges in daily life. For expats, these challenges are exacerbated by unfamiliarity with the healthcare system, lack of government support, language barriers, and isolation from social networks.

Despite growing international awareness and a significant increase in diagnoses, support for expats remains limited, making it difficult to find professional guidance and community resources.

This site aims to create a community hub for autistic expats and their families in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. With an inclusive approach, it seeks to provide support to individuals from diverse social and economic backgrounds, offering a range of services, from professional assistance by certified coaches to volunteer-led community support and social events.

## Design

Design choices took in consideration insights from web design research done with autistic individuals. There's a minimal page structure variation and use of imagery to reduce cognitive load.

## Images

Research with target audience on preference of information in text vs in image is not conclusive. With that in mind, it was chosen to use images withou excess to convey additional information for individuals that process through images, while keeping a suscint text for those who process through written communication. 

While chosing images there was an attempt to chose images with not too many colors or elements with the intent to making them easy to digest.

### Colors

The colors selected for the site were chosen based on research done with autistic users, where it was pointed out that blues and green where calming colors. The palette was generated by Coolors platfomr and tweaked to achieve contrast values required by WCAG guidelines.

### Fonts

Lexend font was selected for the body font, due to it's readability characteristics. Considering that there is an overlap between autism and dyslexia, having a dyslexic-friendly font was deemed as a must. 
Roboto Slab was selected as a heading font to help differentiating levels of importance of content. 
Both fonts are imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

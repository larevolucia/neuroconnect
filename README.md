# NeuroConnect

Neurodivergent individuals (such as those with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, etc.) often face unique challenges in daily life. For expats, these challenges are exacerbated by unfamiliarity with the healthcare system, lack of government support, language barriers, and isolation from social networks.

Despite growing international awareness and a significant increase in diagnoses, support for expats remains limited, making it difficult to find professional guidance and community resources.

This site aims to create a community hub for autistic expats and their families in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. With an inclusive approach, it seeks to provide support to individuals from diverse social and economic backgrounds, offering a range of services, from professional assistance by certified coaches to volunteer-led community support and social events.

## Design

Design choices took in consideration insights from web design research done with autistic individuals. There's a minimal page structure variation and use of imagery to reduce cognitive load.

### Images

Research with target audience on preference of information in text vs in image is not conclusive. With that in mind, it was chosen to use images withou excess to convey additional information for individuals that process through images, while keeping a suscint text for those who process through written communication. 

While chosing images there was an attempt to chose images with not too many colors or elements with the intent to making them easy to digest.

### Colors

The colors selected for the site were chosen based on research done with autistic users, where it was pointed out that blues and green where calming colors. The palette was generated by Coolors platfomr and tweaked to achieve contrast values required by WCAG guidelines.

</details>


### Fonts

Lexend font was selected for the body font, due to it's readability characteristics. Considering that there is an overlap between autism and dyslexia, having a dyslexic-friendly font was deemed as a must. 
Roboto Slab was selected as a heading font to help differentiating levels of importance of content. 
Both fonts are imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Features

### Navigation

Provides a responsive and accessible navigation bar for seamless access to site sections, improving user experience across devices. The design dynamically adapts to screen size, ensuring intuitive and space-efficient navigation on both small and large screens.


- Click behavior on menu icon on smaller screen are achieve by using a checkbox input that is set to hidden. The icon is set as checkbox label. 
- Larger screens display site's name along with logo and display site's section horizontally. Menu icon is hidden using media queries.
- Distinctive color is used to indicate active page. Softer color is used to indicate cursor hover.
- Fixed navigation was achieven using ```position:sticky``` together with left and top attributes to set its position on screen.
- It was decided not to nest ```<nav>``` element in the ```<header>```, due to [accessibility recommendations](https://dev.to/masakudamatsu/don-t-nest-nav-inside-header-do-nest-the-hamburger-menu-button-inside-nav-6cp).
- To comply with accessibility best practices, a ```.sr-only``` class was created, using the suggested code from [WebAIM - Invisible Content Techniques](https://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/). This will ensure that screen readers can still read the content.

### Accessibility Testing  
[issue #16](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/16#issue-2575978267)

- Checked if buttons, links and labels used ```aria-labels```.
- Check if all images had ```alt-text```.
- Used [Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to validate text visibility.
- Checked the usage of Semantic elements.
- Checked visual order follows DOM order using [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) 
- Validated [Design for Target Group #3](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/3#issue-2571162628) with autistic friends
- Checked for errors and alerts on [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) 

### Peer Review and User Feedback

The code was submitted for peer review in the Code Institute community and also received feedback from friends and acquaintances that match the target audience (autistic community).

- Missing feedback on required format for phone number on forms. Removed phone pattern checked on [351398a](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/commit/351398a) and reintroduce with added user feedback on [48a1d4f](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/commit/48a1d4f9acb4d91f04431e66e8f9219ff2f36841)
- Puzzle pieces might be considered offensive. Fixed on [ccd7a82](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/commit/ccd7a82).
- Overwhelming design on Events page. Fixed on [ec50ab1](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/commit/ec50ab1). More on [isue #19](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/19#issue-2608656036)
- Text heavy design on Services page. Fixed on [5d11e3a](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/commit/5d11e3a). More on [issue #25](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/25#issue-2619050363)

### Bugs & Issues

All issues are documented in this [Project View](https://github.com/users/larevolucia/projects/3/views/4)

- Jigsaw CSS validator error: unkown pseudo-class :user-valid. Although documentation on it can be found online at [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_user-valid.php) and and [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:user-valid), I chose to remove it and simplify the form validation experience. Documented on [issue #20](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/20#issue-2611899383)
- Click on label was not selecting corresponding radio button option on forms. Using the W3 check I found that it was due to duplication of ids on content cards and radio buttons. I renamed the content cards id's to be able to fix it. Documented on [issue #21](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/21#issue-2612109157)
- Code clean-up lead to home button misalignment on large screens. To fix it I added a ```min-heigh``` to the ```.card-text``` class on media query for large screens. Documented on [issue #22](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/22#issue-2614516551)
- Initial mobile score for performance was around 75. To improve the score I converted images to webp format, set ```loading="lazy"``` and added difference sources depending on screen size using ```<picture>``` + ```<source>```. Documented on [issue #24](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/24#issue-2618947783)
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) flagged label used for burger menu as an error. To fix it, I added a span to add the text "Menu". To hide it from users, I added a class with ```display: none```. After Code Institute Slack Community feedback, I changed this to a ```sr-only``` class that positions the content outside of the screen. This will enable screen readers to read it. Docummented on [issue #26](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/26#issue-2626933126)
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) flagged ```alt-text``` from a image on home with an alert. To fix it, I changed the text to remove redundancy of "Image of" and made more concise. Docummented on [issue #26](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/26#issue-2626933126)
- After changing image cards to use ```<picture>``` with specific ```source``` for screen distinct screen sizes, the image on home for the events was broken on mobiles. That was due to a broken url, which was fixed on [61c780d](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/commit/61c780df34f5e0a4931dca4c1acae4fae431ad9f). Documented on [issue #27](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/27)
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) alerted the paragraphs for Date and Location on event content cards as possible headings. Peer review provided feedback on the elements, suggesting using semantic elements. Applying the suggestion eliminated the alert. Documented on [issue #29](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/29#issue-2635708429)
- Error on HTML validator on Services page: ```div``` cannot be child of ```span```. Replaced ```span``` with ```div``` to fix the issue. Documented on [issue #28](https://github.com/larevolucia/neuroconnect/issues/28)


### Unfixed issues

- [Jigsaw CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/) warns that due to their dynamic nature, CSS variables are currently not statically checked. As they seem to be working, no action seems to be required.
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) alerts on duplication of links on header due to both the icon/name ```<a>``` element and the first ```<li>``` leading to home. It was not fixed due to an understanding that it is common practice to have a logo on the left leading to the home. Particularly for autistic people it is also benefitial to have a explicit link saying "Home".
